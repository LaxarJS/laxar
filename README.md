# LaxarJS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LaxarJS/laxar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LaxarJS/laxar)

> _Middleware for your web client:_ Create maintainable applications from small, isolated parts.


## Why LaxarJS?

Find out [why](docs/why_laxar.md) you would use LaxarJS and if it's the right tool for you.
Then, explore the [core concepts](docs/concepts.md) and browse the [manuals](docs/manuals/index.md) in the [documentation](docs).

Have a look at the [LaxarJS homepage](http://laxarjs.org) for demos and more information.


## Getting Started

The following is a very minimal getting started guide.
It helps you to set up your first LaxarJS application and to create your first LaxarJS widget.


### Get the Prerequisites

The node package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) is required to get started with LaxarJS.
First we use it to obtain some basic development tools, namely [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli), as well as the Yeoman generator for LaxarJS.

```sh
npm install -g grunt-cli yo
npm install -g generator-laxarjs
```

_Note that_, depending on your workstation setup, you might have to use `sudo` when running `npm install` with the `-g` option.
Make sure that your `PATH` includes the global `node_modules/bin` directory.
For additional information and troubleshooting, consult the documentation of [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com) and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/learning) respectively.


### Create a LaxarJS Application from Our Template

The scaffolding tool `yo` can now be used to create artifacts from the LaxarJS templates.
When asked if you would like to create example widgets, answer with *Yes*.

```sh
mkdir tryout
cd tryout
yo laxarjs
npm install
npm start
```

Visit your fresh application at [http://localhost:8000/debug.html](http://localhost:8000/debug.html).

Press `Ctrl-C` to stop the server for now.


### Create your own LaxarJS widget

Create a widget which simply displays _Hello, world_:

```sh
yo laxarjs:widget
```

Asked for the widget name, let's try `my-first-widget`.

Add some widget-HTML:

```sh
echo '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>' > includes/widgets/my-first-widget/default.theme/my-first-widget.html
```

Add the widget to the page *application/pages/example1.json*, so that it looks like this:

```js
{
   "layout": "two-columns",
   "areas": {
      "left": [
         {
            "widget": "my-first-widget"
         }
      ],
      // ...
   }
}
```

Now you may start the development server again:

```sh
npm start
```

See your *Hello, World!* widget in action at [http://localhost:8000/debug.html](http://localhost:8000/debug.html)


### Create a Compressed Release-Ready Version of Your Application

First, stop the development server using `Ctrl-C`.

```sh
grunt optimize
npm start
```

Now, your production-ready application can be visited at [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html).
You can also use `grunt dist` to get a zip archive containing the application without development server and build tools.


#### Next Steps

Have fun developing your first LaxarJS application.

Make sure to have a look at the [manuals](docs/manuals/index.md) and and check out the demo applications on the [LaxarJS website](http://laxarjs.org/).
If you're already developing your first widgets and want to know which programmatic APIs are provided by LaxarJS, have a look at the [API docs](docs/api).



### Hacking LaxarJS itself

Instead of using a compiled library within a project, you can also clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LaxarJS/laxar.git
cd laxar
npm install
```

To see changes in your application, either configure your project to work with the sources (e.g. by using webpack), or rebuild the webpack bundles by running `npm run optimize`.

To run the automated karma tests:

```sh
npm test
```

To generate HTML spec runners for opening in your web browser, so that you can e.g. use the browser's developer tools:

```sh
npm run browser-spec
```

Now you can select a spec-runner by surfing to http://localhost:8201/spec-output/.
