# Working with Visibility Events

[Â« return to the manuals](index.md)

Visibility events help to improve performance by allowing widgets to determine if they are visible to the user or if they currently reside in the background.

Preliminary readings:

* [LaxarJS Core Concepts](../concepts.md)
* [Widgets and Activities](widgets_and_activities.md)
* [Events and Publish/Subscribe](events.md)
* [Writing Pages](writing_pages.md)

Note that while this manual is rather longish, there is a [TL;DR](#summary-tldr) at the bottom.

## Why Visibility Events?

Some widgets perform *expensive* operations such as:

  - loading and/or display of large amounts of data
  - loading and/or rendering large images and/or movies
  - using expensive controls for things like charts, animations etc.
  - measuring DOM-elements for parameterized animations
  - providing *widget areas* which may in turn host expensive widgets.

If a widget does one or more expensive thing, it should only do so while the widget itself is *visible* to the user.
Frequently, widgets are *hidden* from the user, on page entry or afterwards, due to being nested:

  - within an invisible (closed) popup/popover
  - within an invisible accordion area
  - within an invisible tab area
  - within an invisible show/hide-area.

The so-called *visibility events* help widgets to determine whether their contents may be seen by the user.

If a visibility event tells a widget that it is *hidden*, the widget may stop performing any expensive operations.
If another visibility event tells a widget that it is *visible* (again), that widget may not necessarily be within the visible portion of the page at that time, but might be scrolled into view at any moment.


### Caveat

As with all performance optimizations, be careful not to optimize overly eagerly.
First, LaxarJS performs several optimizations automatically as outlined below.
Also, visibility events may complicate your widget implementations unnecessarily, especially in small applications.

However, unfortunately optimization often *is* necessary: client side web-applications sometimes tend to be slow to load or to feel sluggish, especially on mobile devices.
If you are not satisfied with your application's performance, try to identify the heavy hitting widgets in you application and to control their behavior first.
Also, make sure that visibility event handling can actually help you:
If there are activities on your page causing tons of REST-requests, chances are that optimizing based on visibility may not help at all.


## Handling Visibility Events

An initial set of visibility events is published on page entry by the LaxarJS runtime, after *beginLifecycleRequest* but before *didNavigate*. Widgets may subsequently publish their own visibility events to signal changes to areas that they provide.
These changes are then propagated to nested widget areas by the runtime.

The following section will explain how widgets can access and utilize visibility information.
Afterwards, details follow on *controlling* visibility through events.


### Automatic Handling

The LaxarJS runtime maintains a internal visibility status flag for each widget and for each area.
Even for the widgets that do not care about visibility at all (the majority), the runtime uses this information to determine when the widget DOM is prepared and added to the page DOM, since this may be an expensive process itself.
With AngularJS for example, widget HTML must be compiled and linked, creating all nested directive instances.

Note that widget DOM is *not destroyed* again after the initial attach, until the page is left by the user.
If a widget uses a template with a large number of bindings, it may be beneficial to *cut off* these bindings when invisible, for example by using `ngIf` in an AngularJS widget (next section).


### Manual Handling and Controlling using `axVisibility`

Widgets that need to react to changes of their own visibility should use the `axVisibility` service injection.
The `axVisibility` injection allows to register callbacks using `onShow`, `onHide`, to query the current visibility of a widget using `isVisible()`, and event to `track` the visibility as a property for use in templates (e.g. on the `$scope` of AngularJS widgets).

For widgets that provide their own widget areas and need to change their visibility (accordion widgets, popup widgets, tabbing widgets) the `axVisibility` service provides an `updateAreaVisibility` method.

For full information, refer to the [axVisibility API documentation](../api/runtime.widget_services_visibility.md).


### Advanced: Visibility Propagation over the Event Bus

Similar to how `axI18n` is an abstraction over locale change events, the `axVisibility` injection encapsulates _area visibility change events_.
Usually you do not have to worry about these details and just use the `axVisibility` injection, but read on for a full understanding on how widget visibility is negotiated.

Widget controllers can subscribe to `didChangeAreaVisibility.{area}.{visible}` events.

* Instead of `area`, the name of the surrounding widget area should be used.
  The event payload contains the area name as well, under an attribute `.area`.
  For subscribing, this name available from the `axContext` injection (AngularJS: `$scope`) as attribute `.widget.area`.

* The `visible` value (`true` or `false`) confers the new visibility status of the area and is usually not pre-selected when subscribing.
  The event payload contains this status as well , under a boolean attribute `.visible`.

In the *HTML-template*, `ng-if="isVisible"` may be used to toggle (portions of) the template based on visibility.
Not that this is not useful to speed up initial rendering, due to the automatic DOM handling described above.
The scope-property `isVisible` is maintained by the visibility handler as well, so make sure to have the controller instantiate it.


## Advanced: Controlling Visibility through Events

Most widgets just need to *react* to visibility changes.
Other widgets *provide* areas themselves, directly (like the [laxar-accordion-widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/laxar-accordion-widget)) or through embedded layouts (like the [laxar-popup-widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/laxar-popup-widget)).

Controlling visibility of embedded areas from a widget includes two tasks:

* responding to visibility requests for the provided widget areas

* trigger visibility requests to inform the runtime and other widgets after actively changing an area's visibility.

Usually, `axVisibility` should be used to manage this, but let us have a detailed look into both tasks.


### Responding to Visibility Requests

Initially the LaxarJS runtime publishes `changeAreaVisibility.{area}.{visible}` events for all areas directly within top-level areas, asking them to publish a visibility status for any areas provided by them.

* again, `area` is the name of the widget area of interest

* `visible` is the visibility state of the surrounding area, (`true` for all regular top-level areas, but `false` for the generated `axPopups` and `axPopovers` areas).

Widgets that want to control their area's visibility may now respond with `didChangeAreaVisibility.{area}.{visible}` events containing the actual new visibility state.
If there is no reply for a widget area (for example because the providing widget does not know or care about visibility events), the runtime publishes the `didChangeVisibility` event itself, using the default `visible` value from the request.
Next, all directly nested areas are processed in the same manner, until "bottom" is reached.


### Changing Visibility of Provided Areas

After a widget has modified the visibility of its provided areas, it must publish corresponding `changeAreaVisibilityRequest`-Events.
The `visible`-parameter of these events must be set to the new target value, taking into account the visibility of the surrounding area.

Note that the widget may very well respond to its own visibility requests.

The basic principle of this pattern is similar to that of `takeActionRequest` events:
Even though the controlling widget knows that it is going to handle the request itself, it still starts the visibility modification with a request.
This informs other widgets and especially the runtime of the visibility change.


## Summary (TL;DR)

* Visibility events help to improve render times and to reduce CPU- and memory-use.

* Widgets may *react* to visibility changes by processing `didChangeAreaVisibility` events, directly or using the [`axVisibility`](../api/runtime.widget_services_visibility.md) injection.

* The runtime publishes `didChangeAreaVisibility` events before`didNavigate`.

* Widgets that provide areas and that influence the visibility of those areas *should control* visibility by responding to `changeAreaVisibilityRequest` events.
  Widgets that manage visibility should trigger such requests after initiating a visibility change to any of their provided areas.
  The `axVisibility` injection helps to take care of these tasks as well.
