# Manuals

Before starting with the manuals, make sure that you know [what LaxarJS is about](../why_laxar.md), and that you are familiar with the [core concepts](../concepts.md).
If you're already in the process of developing your first widgets and want to know which programmatic APIs are provided by LaxarJS, have a look at the [API docs](../api).

For developers coming from previous LaxarJS major versions, there is an [upgrade guide](upgrade_guide.md) to ease the transition.
