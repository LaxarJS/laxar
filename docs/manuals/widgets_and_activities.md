# Widgets and Activities

[Â« return to the manuals](index.md)

Widgets and activities are the _"work horse"_ of any LaxarJS application.
They make up the bulk of the user interface and provide all client-side application logic.

Preliminary readings:

* [LaxarJS Core Concepts](../concepts.md)

If you are already familiar with widgets, and just need a refresher on the `widget.json` descriptor, skip to the [reference section](#widget-descriptor-format) below.


## Widget Responsibilities

Before starting to implement your widget, take a moment to think and delineate its responsibilities.
You can do this by phrasing the question: _What goal does this widget help the user to accomplish?_
Are you thinking about a very broadly applicable, technical task such as _"allow the user to enter a date"_ or _"allow the user to delete a data row"_?
In this case you might want to implement this functionality as a _control_ and use it _within_ one or more of your widgets.

Usually, widgets correspond to significant areas of the screen and are composed of multiple controls.
They are built with a _specific user-goal_ in mind, such as _"allow the user to book a flight"_ or _"allow the user to review shopping cart contents"_.
If widgets are made too small and too generic, page definitions will be confusing and the widget configuration options become unwieldy.
As a rule of the thumb, only very complex pages should contain more than a about a dozen widgets.
And who wants to have very complex pages anyway?


### When to use Activities

Activities are _"invisible widgets"_ that are used to _fetch and manage application resources_.
Within the page, they may represent a REST API or a data store, fetching resources and performing relevant service calls (such as a form submission) upon action request.
If you are familiar with AngularJS, you might recognize that activities perform a role similar to AngularJS *services*.
The advantage over services is that using activities puts the _page author_ in control over instantiation and configuration:
Individual widget instances may each be connected to their own activity instance, or share an event bus topic with a single instance.

Activities may also serve as a _mediator_ between widgets that use mutually incompatible event vocabularies (such as different resource formats).
This may happen when integrating a widget from a third party into an application.


### Integration Technologies

LaxarJS serves as a _middleware layer_ that allows you to organize and connect isolated front end components to form an application.
However, it has no say in how the individual widgets and their UI are implemented.
Instead it tries to support you in using readily available frameworks such as React, Vue.JS and Angular.
To integrate widgets that were created in different UI technologies, a piece of glue code is needed, the so-called *integration technology adapter*.

The only adapter included with LaxarJS Core is the adapter for the integration technology `"plain"`, which does not rely on any specific framework, but leaves it up to the widget author to choose what (if any) supporting libraries should be loaded by the widget.

Another adapter offered by the LaxarJS project is the [laxar-angular-adapter](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-angular-adapter-v2-latest/) supporting the integration technology `"angular"`, meaning AngularJS v1.
Because `"angular"` was the built-in technology for LaxarJS v1 and many developers are familiar with its basics, it is still used frequently throughout the examples in this documentation.


#### Combining Integration Technologies

You are encouraged to evaluate different integration technologies for use in your project, especially if you are starting from scratch
For now, the LaxarJS project provides adapters for the technologies [`react`](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-react-adapter-v2-latest/),  [`angular2`](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-angular2-adapter-v2-latest/) and [`vue`](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-vue-adapter-v2-latest/).
Once familiar with the basics, feel free to [create your adapter](./adapters.md).

However, keep in mind that each integration technology adds to your overall application bundle size, impacting application load time and memory consumption.
While mixing three view frameworks may be fine for an intranet application, online applications should generally aim for using a single integration technology, or maybe two technologies during a framework transition -- mobile users will thank you for it!
Of course, `"plain"` is always free and does not weigh in here.


## How to Create a Widget

The easiest way to create a widget is to use the [LaxarJS Yeoman generator](http://laxarjs.org/docs/generator-laxarjs-v2-latest/).
Check out the [README](../../README.md) on how to obtain it, and how to use it for creating an application.

Start by creating a sub-directory for your new widget within the LaxarJS application.
Each widget in an application lives within a sub-folder of the _widget root_ (`application/widgets/` by default).
To change the widget root, you can create a file `laxar.config.js` in your application directory, and use the export `path.widgets` to override the widget root.
The widget path `application/widgets/shopping-cart-widget` is used as an example path throughout this manual.

The last component of the widget path is the so-called _widget directory_, which uses the name of the widget itself.
The widget name must be unique throughout an application and should be written in lower case letters with components separated by dashes.
Widget names always end in `-widget` whereas activities always end in `-activity`.

To create the actual widget, run:

```sh
cd widgets/shopping-cart-widget
yo laxarjs:widget
```

The generator will ask for some details on the widget such as license and author, but you can always edit this information in the widget sources afterwards.
In the following steps, it is assumed that you used the widget name _shopping-cart-widget_ as above.


### Widget Files

A newly created widget contains the following files:

* `widget.json`

  This _widget descriptor_ contains meta-data about your widget that is used by the LaxarJS framework.
  The descriptor contains the name of the widget and specifies both integration type (`"widget"` or `"activity"`) and integration technology (such as `"angular"` or `"react"`).
  Finally, the descriptor allows to describe *configuration options* of your widget features using a JSON schema, so that configuration will be validated automatically.

* `shopping-cart-widget.js`

  The _business logic_ of your shopping cart (like calculating a total or changing item quantities) as a JavaScript module.
  The precise contents of the widget module depend on the integration technology used by your widget.
  Usually, it exports either a class constructor, or a plain factory function to create the widget instance.
  When a widget is instantiated by the LaxarJS runtime, it is passed a set of *widget services* including the *event bus*, which allows for communication with other widget instances.

* `default.theme/shopping-cart-widget.html`

  The _HTML template_ defining the _appearance_ of your widget.
  Again, the integration technology determines the syntax that is supported in the template.
  When your widget is used on a page, LaxarJS will load this automatically and bind it to your widget controller's scope.
  The [Bootstrap CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) classes are made available by the LaxarJS *default.theme* to facilitate uniform styling across widgets.
  If Bootstrap does not suit you, feel free to use a different framework (or none at all) in [your own theme](./creating_themes.md), but keep in mind that this limits opportunities for widget reuse.
  Similarly to controllers, all widget templates will be bundled within a single JSON file when your application is packaged for release.

* `default.theme/css/shopping-cart-widget.css`

  Widget-specific _style definitions_.
  Most of the time, your widget is fine just using CSS style definitions from the global application theme.
  In this case, it can do completely without CSS folders.
  Sometimes though, you have style definitions which are widget-specific (such as CSS animations) and should not be part of the global theme.
  If your widget has its own CSS file, LaxarJS will load it when the widget is used in an application, and bundle it for release.

* `package.json`

  This optional file specifies the _dependencies_ of your widget for use with [NPM](http://npmjs.org/).
  If you want to version and package you widget as a standalone component for use in multiple applications, this is the recommended way to describe the widget and its dependencies.


LaxarJS supports to change the appearance of an existing widget by overriding its template or its CSS styles from within a custom _theme_.
It is also possible to put shared style definitions (CSS classes and SCSS variables) as well as shared assets like fonts and images into that theme.
To get started with some simple styling, you do not have to concern yourself with themes or SCSS.
However they are very useful for adapting widgets to different applications and web sites.
Read [more about themes](./creating_themes.md) once you are familiar with creating and using widgets.


### Widget Files for Testing

The sub folder `spec` contains the widget spec test and, possibly associated resources.
While we recommend writing tests for your widget, note that the spec folder is not required.
None of these files are loaded during regular application runtime.

* `spec/shopping-cart-widget.spec.js`

  This should be a [Jasmine 2](https://jasmine.github.io/2.5/introduction.html) spec test.
  If you used the LaxarJS generator to setup your application including configuration for karma and webpack, this spec can be run on the command-line using [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html), or as an interactive HTML test in the browser, by using the [webpack-jasmine-html-runner-plugin](https://github.com/LaxarJS/webpack-jasmine-html-runner-plugin).

For projects that were generated using the Yeoman generator for LaxarJS, you can start the karma test-runner for your widgets using `npm test`.


### Implementing a Controller

To write the controller for your widget, you will need to implement some business logic.
For a very simple shopping cart this means

* summing the contents of the cart

* increasing or decreasing the quantity of individual positions within the cart.

Throughout this example, we will be using the `angular` integration technology (AngularJS v1), as it is familiar to developers coming from LaxarJS v1.
Different integration technologies should work in a similar fashion.

The Yeoman generator has already created an empty controller along with some AngularJS infrastructure (module and injections).
For a shopping cart, this might be an appropriate starting implementation with some dummy data:

```js
import * as ng from 'angular';

function Controller( $scope ) {
   $scope.model = [
      { label: 'Dairy Dreams', price: 5.25, amount: 1 },
      { label: 'Milky Mocha', price: 12.75, amount: 3 },
      { label: 'Freezing FrappÃ©', price: 18.25, amount: 1 }
   ];

   $scope.increment = item => {
      ++item.amount;
   };

   $scope.decrement = item => {
      item.amount = Math.max( 0, item.amount - 1 );
   };

   $scope.total = rows => rows.reduce(
      (total, item) => total + item.price * item.amount,
      0
   );
}

export const name = ng.module( 'shoppingCartWidget' )
   .controller( 'ShoppingCartWidgetController' ).name;
```

The adapter for the integration technology `"angular"` makes it possible for a widget controller in LaxarJS to work just like any other AngularJS controller.
Of course, things will get more interesting once you use the event bus to receive shopping cart contents from somewhere else, or to signal that an order should be placed.


### Creating a Template

The purpose of creating an HTML template is to provide your widget with an appearance on the screen.
For anyone familiar with Bootstrap and AngularJS, most of this should not be a surprise:

```HTML
<h4 ng-bind-html="features.headline.htmlText"></h4>
<table class="table">
   <thead>
   <tr>
      <th>Beverage</th>
      <th class="cart-amount">Price</th>
      <th class="cart-price">Amount</th>
      <th></th>
   </tr>
   </thead>
   <tfoot>
   <tr>
      <th colspan="3" class="cart-price">{{ total( model ) }}</th>
      <th></th>
   </tr>
   </tfoot>
   <tr ng-repeat="item in model">
      <td>{{ item.label }}</td>
      <td class="cart-amount">{{ item.amount }}</td>
      <td class="cart-price">{{ item.price }}</td>
      <td>
         <button ng-click="decrement( item )" class="btn btn-xs">
            <i class="fa fa-minus" /></button>
         <button ng-click="increment( item )" class="btn btn-xs">
            <i class="fa fa-plus" /></button>
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>
```

Note that the LaxarJS runtime will wrap the DOM of each widget within a single DIV container.
The scope of the template is the same as for the controller so that `model`, `decrement`, `increment` and `total` will be available upon template instantiation.
The `features` property used within the headline comes from the _widget configuration_, which is described below.


### Adding Some Style

A widget may be styled using CSS, or its more fancy variants such as LESS or SCSS.
To keep things simple, you can ignore SCSS and themes for now and simply write a CSS file for your widget, in our case under `default.theme/css/shopping-cart-widget.css`.
Once you are familiar with the basics, read the article on [creating themes](./creating_themes.md) for more information.

Thanks to Bootstrap CSS, this widget does not require a lot of fancy styling:

```CSS
.shopping-cart-widget .cart-amount,
.shopping-cart-widget .cart-price {
   text-align: right;
}
```

For best encapsulation, selectors should be prefixed with the widget class (`.shopping-cart-widget`) as shown here.
LaxarJS automatically adds this class to the widget container, so there is no need to specify it in the widget template.
It is also recommended to prefix custom CSS classes as shown here (`cart-amount`, `cart-price`), just as you would prefix custom HTML elements or attributes.
This makes widget styles more robust against changes in Bootstrap or other third party CSS.


### Configuration Options

When looking at the template, you might have wondered where the `features.headline.htmlText` came from.
This is a _feature configuration_ option of our widget:
We want to be able to control the headline text for each instance of our widget.
For this reason, we specify a configuration option by adding a feature entry to the `widget.json`:

```JSON
{
   "name": "shopping-cart-widget",
   "description": "Allows Users to Review and Modify Purchase Items",

   "features": {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
         "headline": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
               "htmlText": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "description": "the HTML headline content"
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

The _widget features_ are a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org) document that is used by LaxarJS to verify pages.
It contains a property for each configurable feature, and it also allows to specify default values as needed.
This makes it easy to provide self-documenting customization options for your widget.
See the [reference section](#reference) for details on the widget specification.
Note that this schema is _optional_.
If a widget descriptor does not specify a schema, any configuration will be considered valid and passed to the widget controller, which can be useful for prototyping.
However, it is strongly recommended to add a schema before releasing a widget or putting it into production, if only to _document_ the available configuration.


### Checking out the Result

Before we can take a look at the widget, we will need to integrate it into the page provided by the application template (`application/pages/page1.json`).

```JSON
{
   "layout": "one_column",

   "areas": {
      "activities": [],
      "header": [],
      "content": [
          {
             "widget": "shopping-cart-widget",
             "features": {
                "headline": {
                   "htmlText": "My Shopping Cart"
                }
             }
          }
      ],
      "footer": []
   }
}
```

I you would like to know more, there is dedicated manual to learn more about [writing pages](./writing_pages.md).

Now we can start the development web server provided by LaxarJS, from the application root:

```sh
npm install # if you have not already
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/debug.html` to admire the fruits of your labor:

![CartWidget](widgets_and_activities/cart_widget.png)

Now that you have learned the basics in _creating_ widgets, take a closer look at widget _testing._


## Testing a Widget

One of the major goals of LaxarJS is to simplify the development _and testing_ of isolated components.
For this reason, a basic widget test has already been prepared when using `yo laxarjs:widget`.


### Writing Spec-Tests

For testing widgets and activities in isolation, we recommend to use the library [LaxarJS Mocks](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-mocks-v2-latest/), which allows to setup a test bed for widgets that were created in any integration technology.
There you'll also find manuals and [an introduction](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-mocks-v2-latest/manuals/introduction/) on how to test widgets in isolation.


### Running the Test

The [LaxarJS Mocks Setup Instructions](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-mocks-v2-latest/) explain how to run widget tests from the command line using karma, or interactively using a generated HTML test runner.
Hopefully this makes it simple to set up continuous testing for your application.

## LaxarJS Widget Reference

Building on top of the basics covered so far, sometimes it is helpful to know about all the options available to widget authors.
This section covers the details of the widget specification format and the properties available on the `$scope` in case of an AngularJS widget.


### Widget Descriptor Format

Each widget has a `widget.json` file which is also called _widget descriptor_.
LaxarJS contains a [widget schema definition](../../static/schemas/widget.json) that defines the exact format of this file.
These are the most important widget properties:

* `name`

  This required field contains the name of the widget, used to find its implementation module, template and stylesheet. The name must match the spelling and case of the module name (minus `.js` extension) exactly.

* `description`

  What this widget is about.
  Ideally, this contains the main _user-goal_ mentioned in the first section.

* `features`

  The widget features.
  This is an optional (but highly recommended) JSON schema object that documents the configurable widget features.
  For each widget instance used on a page, LaxarJS will check the feature configuration of that instance against this schema.
  This also allows to provide default values for configuration options.

* `compatibility`

  An optional list of new LaxarJS features that this widget is compatible with.
  It allows individual widgets to _opt in_ to breaking LaxarJS changes (similarly to the Python _import from future_ construct), without harming widgets that do not yet support these changes.

  In the past, this was used to opt-in to a new event vocabulary.
  Right now, there are no upcoming features to be activated here.

* `controls`

  An optional list of LaxarJS controls used by this widget.
  Each control is represented by its path, which may either be relative to the controls-root (usually `application/controls`) or resolvable by the module loader (webpack).
  This allows the LaxarJS runtime to automatically load the modules and CSS styles associated with these controls whenever your widget is used.
  Refer to [Providing Controls](./providing_controls.md) on loading user interface components and their resources in this manner.

* `templateSource`

  You can load the template from a different source in order to support a preprocessing syntax such as [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) or [pug](https://pugjs.org/).
  Simply set the `templateSource` to the respective path relative to the theme folder, such as `shopping-cart-widget.pug` and make sure that an appropriate (webpack) loader is installed.

* `styleSource`

  Instead of CSS you can also use [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) or [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), by providing this entry in the `widget.json`, which must be a path within the theme-folder (for example `scss/shopping-cart-widget.scss`).
  Make sure that you have a (webpack) loader installed to handle the file type of your choice.


### Widget Services

The widget controller has access to a set of injectable widget services, which are described in detail in the [manual on widget services](./widget_services.md).

When using the integration technology `"angular"`, these are passed as AngularJS controller injections, along with the AngularJS `$scope`.
The LaxarJS angular adapter puts some additional properties on the scope that simplify writing templates and controller logic:

* `$scope.features`

  An alias to the `axFeatures` widget service injection, useful for (one-time) template bindings.

* `$scope.eventBus`

  An alias to the `axEventBus` widget service injection, for publish/subscribe interaction.

* `$scope.widget.id`

 A unique identifier for this widget within the page.
 You can use it to generate unique DOM IDs, for example to connect `label` and `input` elements in an HTML form.
