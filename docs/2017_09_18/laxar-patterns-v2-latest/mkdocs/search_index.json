It also returns the promise\nreturned by the underlying event bus call.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nconst\n \npublisher\n \n=\n \nresources\n.\nupdatePublisherForFeature\n(\n \ncontext\n,\n \npath\n \n);\n\n\npublisher\n.\ncompareAndPublish\n(\n \nobsoleteVersion\n,\n \ncurrentVersion\n \n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that a generic generation of patches might lead to strange, large patch sequences, especially when\nremoving entries. The diff library doesn't know about identities and as such won't recognize where a\nspecific element was removed.

The\nvalidation result is always signaled through one or more generated error messages or the absence of\nthese messages. So valid results may be a string, an i18n object, an array of the former, \nnull\n or\nan empty array. \nnull\n and an empty array signal a successful validation.\n\n\nThe validator receives the event object for the \nvalidateRequest\n event and its according \nmeta\n object.\n\n\nThe way these messages are returned by the validator may be one of two ways, depending on the nature\nof the validation:\n\n\n\n\nif the validation can be handled synchronously, the result should simply be returned directly\n\n\nin case the validation is asynchronous, a promise must be returned, which must be resolved with the\n  same kind of values as for the synchronous case\n\n\n\n\nIf the validator throws an error or the promise is rejected, this is treated as a failed validation.\nSince this is due to a programming error, the error or rejection cause will be logged and a\nconfigurable message will instead be send in the \ndidValidate\n event. The message is assumed to be\nfound in the global configuration at \nlib.laxar-patterns.validation.i18nHtmlExceptionMessage\n as string\nor i18n object. If it cannot be found, an empty string is send as message.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nvalidation\n.\nhandlerFor\n(\n \ncontext\n,\n \nconfiguration\n,\n \nlog\n,\n \ni18n\n \n)\n\n   \n.\nregisterResource\n(\n \ntheAmount\n,\n \n(\n \nevent\n,\n \nmeta\n \n)\n \n=\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \ncontext\n.\nresources\n.\ntheAmount\n \n \n1000\n;\n\n   \n}\n \n)\n\n   \n.\nregisterResource\n(\n \ncurrentUser\n,\n \n(\n \nevent\n,\n \nmeta\n \n)\n \n=\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nfetchUserValidityRules\n()\n\n         \n.\nthen\n(\n \nrules\n \n=\n \ncontext\n.\nresources\n.\ncurrentUser\n.\nmeets\n(\n \nrules\n \n)\n \n)\n\n         \n.\nthen\n(\n \nvalid\n \n=\n \n{\n\n            \nreturn\n \nvalid\n \n?\n \nnull\n \n:\n \nThe current user isn\\\nt valid for some reason.

resources and to collaborate on them.\nBecause events are always delivered \nby copy\n, there is no danger of widgets and activities performing conflicting operations on shared mutable state.\n\n\nThe Master/Slave Pattern\n\n\nWhen using the LaxarJS resource pattern, for a given resource there is usually a single widget (or activity) responsible for \nproviding\n it, in order for others to collaborate.\nIf applicable, that widget (the \nresource master\n) is also capable of persisting modifications to the resource.\nThe other collaborators are \nslaves\n with respect to the shared resource.\n\n\nOnly the resource master may change the \nidentity\n of a shared resource, while the slaves may only trigger \nmodifications to the state\n of the resource.\n\n\nExample: Shopping Cart\n\n\nAs an example, consider a shopping cart widget that displays a list of \npositions\n (articles and quantities) in a web shop application.\nThe user may select any of the positions, and a second widget will then show details on the \nselected-position\n resource, such as a photo of the corresponding article.\nThe shopping cart widget is the resource master here, because it alone determines which article is currently selected.\nThe details widget is a slave, it can only act with respect to the currently selected article.\n\n\nThe details widget might even allow to modify the quantity of a given article within the cart, causing the shopping cart to remove a position when its quantity reaches zero.\nHowever, the slave can never change \nwhich\n position is currently the \nselected-position\n .\n\n\nThe \ndidReplace\n and \ndidUpdate\n Events\n\n\nThe identity and initial state of a resource is published through the \ndidReplace\n event by the resource master.\nModifications to a resource may be published through the \ndidUpdate\n event, by master or slaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent name\n\n\nPayload Attribute\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndidReplace.{resource}\n\n\n\n\n\n\npublished by a resource master to define state and identity of a shared resource\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresource\n\n\nstring\n\n\nthe topic through which the resource is shared (used in the payload \nas well as\n in the event name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata\n\n\nobject\n\n\nthe (initial or new) state of the resource\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndidUpdate.{resource}\n\n\n\n\n\n\npublished by a resource master or by its slaves to publish modifications to the state of a shared resource\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresource\n\n\nstring\n\n\nsee above\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatches\n\n\narray\n\n\nA \nJSON-Patch\n document (an array representing a sequence of incremental modifications)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause modifications \n(didUpdate)\n are transmitted incrementally, the resource master may use the \npatches\n attribute of the event payload to persist modifications using an \nHTTP PATCH\n request.\nTo create and apply patches, you require \nlaxar-patterns\n into your widget controller and use \ncreatePatch\n and \napplyPatch\n from its \njson\n API.\n\n\nIn support of a unidirectional data flow we strongly advise to only send updates from the master to the slaves and not the other way around.\nThis ensures that there really is only one source for the most recent state of a resource, and changes to it are encapsulated in just one location.\nSo instead of sending a \ndidUpdate\n event a slave expresses its wish to induce a modification on a resource via \ntakeActionRequest\n to the master.\nThe master then can modify the resource accordingly (possibly via server roundtrip) and publish the updated version as a whole via \ndidReplace\n or partially via \ndidUpdate\n event.\n\n\nWhen sharing resources, keep in mind that resource events (like all LaxarJS events) are cloned for each receiver.\nThis makes it easy to write robust applications, but can lead to inefficiencies if very large resources are published.\nIn some cases, it might be worthwhile to factor out sub-resources relevant to the consumers.\n\n\nAsynchronous Resource Validation\n\n\nOften the individual widgets sharing a resource know best how to validate their specific user input.\nHowever, in the context of persistence or navigation the validity state of the overall resource or of the entire page is of interest.\n\n\nWidgets and activities concerned with navigation and persistence should not be exposed to the details of resource validation [1].\nTo separate these concerns, widgets may issue \nrequests to validate a resource\n which other widgets may respond to.\nRespondents may choose to validate immediately or asynchronously.\n\n\nThe \nvalidateRequest, willValidate\n and \ndidValidate\n Events\n\n\nA widget may request validation of a resource using a \nvalidateRequest\n event.\nCollaborators capable of performing validation on this resource respond by publishing a \nwillValidate\n event.\nAfter they have performed validation, possibly asynchronously, collaborators publish a \ndidValidate\n event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent
