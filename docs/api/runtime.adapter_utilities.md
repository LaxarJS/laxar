Provides access to the configuration that was passed during application bootstrapping.

A *Configuration* instance provides convenient readonly access to the underlying LaxarJS
application bootstrapping configuration. The configuration values are passed to
[`laxar#create()`](-unknown-#create) on startup (before LaxarJS v2.x, these configuration values were read from
`window.laxar`). When using the LaxarJS application template, the configuration values are set in the
file `init.js` under your project's root directory.
